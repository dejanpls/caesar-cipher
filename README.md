# Caesar Cipher 

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher">TOP Fundamentals Course</a>

Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xNpbosfTY">this video</a> if you need more info on what Caesar Cipher is.

### How it works
* A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. 
* It uses a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some ```fixed number of spaces``` to yield an encoding alphabet. 
* With a ```shift``` of ```1``` would ```encode``` an ```A``` as a ```B```, an ```M``` as an ```N```, and a ```Z``` as an ```A```, and so on.

The method is named after Roman leader Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
